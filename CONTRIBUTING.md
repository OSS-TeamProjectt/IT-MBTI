We recommend adding unit tests for any bug fixes or new features:
1. Write tests for both successful and failing cases.
2. Include your tests in the same pull request as your feature or bug fix.
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request:
```
npm test

Unit tests ensure the project's reliability and help prevent regressions in future updates.
